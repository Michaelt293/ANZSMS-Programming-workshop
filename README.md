# ANZSMS-Programming-workshop
Programming workshop given at the 2015 Australian and New Zealand Society for Mass Spectrometry conference. 

Data processing and data analysis are vital aspects of mass spectrometry. While a vast array of tools already exist to aid mass spectrometric analysis, working at the coal face means that tools specific to your application may not exist. Knowledge in programming can help overcome these obstacles and can also streamline data processing.

In this programming workshop, we will focus on the Python programming language. Python (named after Monty Python), is an open-source, high-level programming language popular in many areas of scientific research. The emphasis on code readability and clean syntax makes Python an ideal programming language for scientists.

The workshop will be divided into a hands-on tutorial and a presentation. In the hands-on tutorial, attendees are encouraged to bring their laptop (with Python pre-installed) and actively participate. In the tutorial, we will cover the basics of programming in Python and progress to writing code relevant to the mass spectrometrist (e.g. calculating the mass of a peptide). In the presentation, Jason Mulvenna and Jeremy Potriquet will discuss how Python is used in their research at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute.
